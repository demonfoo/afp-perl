Net::AFP version 0.61.1
=======================

This collection of modules implements the Apple Filing Protocol stack in
Perl. It contains several separate modules which implement components
that allow it to do its work:

    Net::DSI - A Perl implementation of the DSI mid-layer protocol over TCP
    Net::AFP - A superclass implementing generic AFP operations
    Net::AFP::TCP - A derivative of Net::AFP implementing TCP transport
    Net::AFP::Atalk - A derivative of Net::AFP implementing AppleTalk transport
    Net::AFP::Fuse - A derivative of Fuse::Class implementing a Fuse filesystem
    Net::AFP::UAMs - A utility module for calling User Authentication Methods
    Net::AFP::Versions - A utility module for protocol version agreement
                         and checking
    Net::AFP::ACL - A package providing symbols related to using AFP's
                    Access Control List implementation
    Net::AFP::Result - Symbols for known AFP result codes, and mappings of
                       result codes to error strings
    Net::AFP::Parsers - A utility module for parsing various common packed
                        data types and structures from an AFP server

This code is known to work on Linux, FreeBSD (8.x), NetBSD and MacOS X/Darwin.
It makes use of Perl ithreads, so requires a threaded build of Perl.
I have attempted to test this module on both Solaris (well, OpenSolaris)
and Windows; unfortunately there seem to be threading deficiencies on
both that make the code non-functional there.
