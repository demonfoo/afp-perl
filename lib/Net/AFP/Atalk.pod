Net::AFP::Atalk - Perl module implementing AFP over AppleTalk interface

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package implements the necessary methods to interface to an
AFP over AppleTalk server. It is a subclass of Net::AFP, which
implements the generic parts of the AFP protocol; this module adds
AFP over AppleTalk specific code. See L<Net::AFP/AFP SERVER COMMANDS>
for a list of all the inherited methods which can be called against the
instantiated object.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item new()

Create a new instance of a Net::AFP::Atalk session. Should always
be called like:

Net::AFP::Atalk->new(...);

or:

new Net::AFP::Atalk (...);

DO NOT call:

Net::AFP::Atalk::new(...);

This calling convention will not work.

=over

=item $host

The AppleTalk host address of the target AFP server to initiate a
session with.

=item $port

The DDP port number of the running AFP server.

=back

Error replies (may not be comprehensive):

=over

=item kFPNoServer

Server was not connected.

=item kFPServerGoingDown

Server is shutting down.

=back

=item close()

Close an open connection to an AFP over AppleTalk server. Any open files,
volumes and other handles should be closed out before this is called,
and FPLogout() should be called to close the session out.

=over

=item $self

An instance of Net::AFP::Atalk which is to be shut down and
disbanded.

=back

Error replies:

None.

=item SendAFPMessage()

Private method, used internally by Net::AFP for dispatching
AFP requests. Do not use.

=item SendAFPWrite()

Private method, used internally by Net::AFP for dispatching
AFP write requests. Do not use.

=item GetStatus()

Requests information about an AFP over AppleTalk server. Should not be called
against an open session; only call this method as follows:

Net::AFP::Atalk->GetStatus(...);

Other calling conventions will not work correctly.

Note that this returns the same data structure that FPGetSrvrInfo() does, but
is intended for getting server information prior to setting up a full-on
session with the server.

=over

=item $host

The AppleTalk host address of the target AFP server to initiate a
session with.

=item $port

The DDP port number of the running AFP server.

=item $resp_r

A scalar reference which will contain the parsed data structure from
the remote server upon success.
