=head1 NAME

Net::AFP - Perl module implementing an interface for accessing Apple
Filing Protocol exports

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This package should not be used directly in most cases. It implements only
the methods to support general AFP operations. Low-level details of the
transport/connection setup/etc. are handled by the protocol-specific
packages C<Net::AFP::TCP> and C<Net::AFP::Atalk>. Use them instead.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package forms the basis for a Perl class providing an interface to
connect to an AFP server and perform operations on remote files and
directories within an exported share.

This class is not intended for direct use - currently, the
C<Net::AFP::TCP> and C<Net::AFP::Atalk> packages derive this class.
This class implements generalized functionality; protocol-specific
functionality is completely abstracted out from this class.

Note that not all AFP operations are implemented. The documentation describes
a few functions which I have not implemented due to lack of need.

=head2 Path Type Constants

Constants indicating the type of names in a C<$Pathname> parameter.

=over

=item $kFPShortName

Indicates that a C<$Pathname> parameter contains Short Names.

=item $kFPLongName

Indicates that a C<$Pathname> parameter contains Long Names.

=item $kFPUTF8Name

Indicates that a C<$Pathname> parameter contains an AFPName, which
consists of a four-byte text encoding hint followed a two-byte length,
followed by a UTF-8 encoded pathname.

=back

=head2 File Creation Constants

Constants used when creating files. These constants are used in the
C<Flag> parameter for the L</FPCreateFile()> command.

=over

=item $kFPSoftCreate

Indicates soft file creation; i.e., create only if a file does not exist.

=item $kFPHardCreate

Indicates hard file creation; i.e., if the file already exists, destroy it.

=back

=head2 Catalog Node Names

Catalog node (CNode) names identify every directory and file in a volume
catalog. Each directory and file has a Long Name (L</$kFPLongName>),
Short Name (L</$kFPShortName>, and may also have an AFPName
(L</$kFPUTF8Name>).

Long Names and Short Names correspond in two of the native file systems
that AFP supports; the Mac OS refers to files and directories by Long
Names; MS-DOS computers use Short Names.

AFPNames are encoded in conformance with the Unicode standard (UTF-8),
which can use a varying number of bits to represent a very large character
space. To keep character coding simple and efficient, the Unicode Standard
assigns each character a unique numeric value and name. To help when
converting UTF-8 to other script systems, AFPNames begin with a 4-byte
text encoding hint that specified the script that was originally used to
compose the name. The text encoding hint is followed by a two-byte length
field specifying the length of the UTF-8 encoded name that follows.

=head2 File Sharing Modes

AFP controls user access to shared files in two ways. The first, described
in L</"AFP File Server Security">, provides security by controlling user
access to specific directories. The second, described in this section,
preserves data integrity by controlling a user's access to a file while it
is being used by another user.

To control simultaneous file access, the file server must enforce
synchronization rules. These rules prevent applications from damaging each
other's files by modifying the same version simultaneously. These rules
also prevent users from obtaining access to information while it is being
changed.

Synchronization rules are built from the mode in which a first user and
subsequent users open a file. AFP provides two classes of modes: access
modes and deny modes.

=head3 Access and Deny Modes

Most file systems use a set of permissions to regulate the opening of
files. This set includes permission to modify the contents of a file
(read-write) and permission to see the file's contents (read only). In
a stand-alone system, these two file-access modes are sufficient.

In the shared environment of a file server, this set of permissions, or
access modes, is expanded. In addition to the expanded set of access
modes, a set of restrictions is provided by deny modes.

A user application can specify an access mode and a deny mode when it opens a file on the file server. AFP supports the access modes: read, write, read-write, and none. None access allows no further access to the fork, except to close it, and may be useful in implementing synchronization. In addition to one of these access modes, the user indicates a deny mode to the server to specify which rights should be denied to others trying to open the fork while the first user has it open. Users that subsequently try to open that fork can be denied read, write, read-write, or none access.

A user sending an L</FPOpenFork()> command can be denied file access for
the following reasons:

* The user does not possess the rights (as owner, group, or Everyone) to
open the file with the requested access mode. A result code of
L<Net::AFP::Result/kFPAccessDenied> is returned.

* The fork is already open with a deny mode that prohibits the second
user's requested access. For example, the first user opened the fork
with a deny mode of DenyWrite, and the second user tries to open the for
in the write mode. A L<Net::AFP::Result/kFPDenyConflict> result code is
returned to the second user.

* The fork is already open with an access mode that conflicts with the
second user's requested deny mode. For example, the first user opened the
fork for Write access and a deny mode of DenyNone. The second user tries
to open the fork with a deny mode indicating DenyWrite. This request is
not granted because the fork is already open for Write access. A
L<Net::AFP::Result/kFPDenyConflict> result code is returned to the second
user.

Deny modes are cumulative in that each successful opening of a fork
combines its deny mode with previous deny modes. Therefore, if the first
user opening a file specifies a deny mode of DenyRead, and the second
user specifies DenyWrite, the fork's current deny mode is
DenyRead-Write. DenyNone and DenyRead combine to form a current deny mode
of DenyRead.

Similarly, access modes are cumulative. If the first user opening a file
has Read access and the second has Write access, the current access mode
is Read-Write.

=head3 Synchronization Rules

Synchronization rules, as previously discussed, allow or deny
simultaneous access to a file fork. They are based on the current deny
mode and current access mode of the fork and on the new deny and access
modes being requested in a new FPOpenFork command. Synchronization rules
are summarized below. An asterisk indicates that a new open command has
succeeded; otherwise, it has failed.

=head1 DEVELOPER NOTES

Notes related to netatalk:

- Netatalk sends its own L<DSICloseSession|Net::DSI/DSICloseSession>
request packet to the client. This is not in keeping with the AFP and
DSI protocol specs; the L<DSICloseSession|Net::DSI/DSICloseSession>
packet from the server gets dropped because the FIN/ACK has already been
sent by that time. It doesn't appear to bother the code, but it's weird.

- Also, Netatalk will in certain cases return a positive (undefined)
error code; it uses the received data structure to assemble its
reply, and the error code field is the same field that contains the
data offset pointer. I've implemented a hack in L<Net::DSI|Net::DSI> (in the
thread main loop) to work around this.

- Discovered that Netatalk's DSI implementation doesn't like getting
Tickle packets before the session has been opened; made a little
workaround for that.

Notes on AFP:

- Apple's documentation of the L</FPChangePassword()> method indicates that
no response block will be returned; in the case of anything more
complicated than the Plaintext UAM, this is categorically wrong. Most
UAMs need to perform two-way conversations for their password change
operations.

- Apple's documentation of the L</FPLogin()> operation is wrong. Their docs
indicate a pad byte after the command code byte. I have verified
empirically that no server implementation does this.

- Apple's documentation of the L</FPLoginCont()> operation indicates that the
UserAuthInfo block will only be present if
L<kFPAuthContinue|Net::AFP::Result/kFPAuthContinue> is returned; the 2-way
randnum UAM returns L<kFPNoErr|Net::AFP::Result/kFPNoErr> and a
C<UserAuthInfo> block in the last stage of its authentication path.

- Apple's documentation of the L</FPMapID()> and L</FPMapName()> operations was
not properly updated in AFP 3.1 and 3.2 to cover the sending/receiving of
UUIDs. The AFP 3.3 documentation does, but butchers the data type - a
UUID is 128 bits, not 64, so a C<uint64_t> isn't possibly large enough.
Getting it as a 16-byte string instead, which works for us fine.

- Apple's documentation of the L</FPSetACL()> operation provides a visual
representation of the data layout in the C<kFPSetACL> message. It claims
there is a MaxReplySize field between the Bitmap and PathType fields.
No such field is present (verified empirically).

- Apple's documentation of the L</FPSetForkParms()> operation indicates that
the data field is only 4 bytes, while it also claims that it can be used
to set the extended resource and data fork lengths. Code was altered to
pass a C<long long> in the message payload when the extended params are
to be set.

- Apple's documentation for the L</FPWrite()> operation indicates it returns
the number of bytes written. It does not, and has never done this;
however, it does return an integer value (32 bits for L</FPWrite()>, 64
bits for L</FPWriteExt()>) indicating the offset after the last write request.

- It seems that Apple (as of the AFP implementation contained in their
AirDisk devices, e.g., the Airport Express 802.11n Dualband) either forgot
about or changed their minds about write-only files via AFP. Opening
a fork with the "write-only" flag, and then attempting to write to that
open handle, yields failed writes. Opening the file as read-write in
that case allows successful writes.

- The L</FPMoveAndRename()> call docs seem to indicate a value (aside from the
status code) is expected to be returned; it would appear the docs were
probably based on text copied from L</FPMapName()>'s docs. The docs
in Inside AppleTalk don't seem to indicate any such return value, and packet
captures back that up. So, I'm guessing this is an error.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

L<Log::Log4perl|Log::Log4perl> for message handling. Most other
dependencies are endemic to the top-level modules that implement the
specific transport layers, L<Net::AFP::TCP|Net::AFP::TCP> and
L<Net::AFP::Atalk|Net::AFP::Atalk>.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

Don't know of any bugs yet, but they're probably in there...

My unicode handling is probably imperfect; some Korean scripts probably
aren't handled right, along with certain characters that Mac OS prefers
be composed instead of uncomposed (but most have to be uncomposed)...

Also need to handle disconnections better.

Unimplemented functions:

 - FPCatSearch
 - FPCatSearchExt
