libnet-afp-perl (0.70-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Regex workaround to improve compatibility with Perl 5.8.
  * Moved connection code into a separate module (Net::AFP::Helpers), to
    keep everything using a consistent code path for server connections.
  * Added 'afp_chpass.pl' command line tool, for changing passwords on
    AFP servers.
  * Fix unlink() implementation in Net::AFP::Fuse to work around FPAccess()
    always dereferencing symlinks.
  * Documentation cleanups.
  * Corrected some flag names.
  * Simplified some of the parsing loops in Net::AFP::Parsers, and made better
    use of Perl functionality in certain places.
  * Fail more quietly if Socket6 isn't available.
  * Fixed up error return mappings in extended attribute handling code.
  * Use the ModTime field for all of atime, mtime and ctime. Don't update any
    time fields for atimes.
  * Fixed FPGetUserInfo() implementation.
  * Added handling of the -o switch in afpmount.pl (more than just "we accept
    it, and ignore it"). Handle the 'debug' mount option.
  * Implemented opendir(), readdir(), releasedir(), fsyncdir(), access(),
    create(), ftruncate(), fgetattr(), lock(), utimens() and bmap() operations,
    since Fuse 0.12 and up (and an update of Fuse::Class that's coming) support
    these operations.
  * Better handling of request lengths for listxattr() and getxattr()
    implementations in Net::AFP::Fuse.
  * Now using filehandles for file operations, instead of always keying on path.
    Support added as of Fuse 0.09_4; this eliminates a lot of unnecessary
    access checking, and simplifies read() and write() code a lot.
  * Removed write coalescing code; use '-o big_writes' instead (as of Fuse 0.12,
    option parsing fixes are included that make '-o big_writes' actually work).
  * Added some simple metrics collection code to Net::AFP::Fuse. The '._metrics'
    file is associated with the metrics collection code; cat that file to see
    the collected metrics data.
  * Round time offsets to the nearest half-hour, to keep the times on files
    consistent.
  * Added special support for 'com.apple.ResourceFork' and
    'com.apple.FinderInfo' xattrs; Mac OS X/MacFUSE use those for accessing
    those features, since the FUSE API doesn't provide mechanisms for them
    natively.
  * Improve compatibility with pre-AFP 3.0 (and especially pre-AFP 2.2)
    implementations.
  * Use the list of addresses passed by the server in the GetStatus() call
    to determine what service to connect to for our transport session. This
    allows us to use NBP names for service discovery, and still connect via
    TCP/IP for performance when servers know how to.
  * Added '-4'/'--prefer-v4' and '--atalk-first' options to afpsh.pl and
    afpmount.pl.
  * Compatibility hack for AirPort Disk devices, to avoid a leading '..'
    on any file names.
  * More inline docs.
  * Present resource fork and finder data via extended attributes. Also
    improves OS X compatibility.
  * Renamed Net::AFP::Fuse to Fuse::AFP.

libnet-afp-perl (0.62.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Correct the return code from removexattr() in the case where the
    attribute to be removed is not present.
  * Correct notes about an issue with '.DS_Store' to reference the
    actual cause.
  * Fix the time handling to get all 3 times from the 'ModTime' field, and
    ignore the last-accessed time in the utime() call. This appears to be
    how Apple's AFP client does things.
