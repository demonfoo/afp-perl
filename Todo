- Handle shutdown announcements better (we currently receive them, but don't
  really do anything with them).
- Kerberos support?
- Reconnect UAM support?
- Maybe DBus integration so we can call FPZzzzz() appropriately before the
  machine goes to sleep?
- Metadata caching
- Instead of unlinking a file that's open when unlinking/renaming over,
  rename to .[key][random] and remove in release() handler upon last close.
- Suicide main process if AFP connection goes bust?
