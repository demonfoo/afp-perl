- Handle shutdown announcements better (we currently receive them, but don't
  really do anything with them).
- Kerberos support?
- Reconnect UAM support?
- Maybe DBus integration so we can call FPZzzzz() appropriately before the
  machine goes to sleep?
- Possibly work around issue with Apple AirPort Disk with any file starting
  with the characters '..' - thought this was something with the '.DS_Store'
  string being magic, but that doesn't seem to be it.
