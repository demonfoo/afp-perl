- Use the list of network addresses the server provides us to figure out the
  best way to connect for actual file service.
- Handle shutdown announcements better (we currently receive them, but don't
  really do anything with them).
- Maybe see about AppleDouble-style resource fork support?
- Kerberos support?
- Reconnect UAM support?
- Maybe DBus integration so we can call FPZzzzz() appropriately before the
  machine goes to sleep?
- Work around an issue with rsync where the source filesystem contains a
  '.DS_Store' file, and when trying to rsync a directory onto an AFP mount,
  rsync gets stuck in a loop trying to open() a ..DS_Store.XXXXXX file with
  O_CREAT, and receives EEXIST every time. rsync will (apparently?) keep on
  doing this forever.
