- Fix removal of dead symlinks (problem due to FPAccess() failing on
  ACL-enabled mounts).
- Use the list of network addresses the server provides us to figure out the
  best way to connect for actual file service.
- Handle shutdown announcements better (we currently receive them, but don't
  really do anything with them).
- Maybe see about AppleDouble-style resource fork support?
- Kerberos support?
- Reconnect UAM support?
- Maybe DBus integration so we can call FPZzzzz() appropriately before the
  machine goes to sleep?
