- Improve dead peer detection in Net::DSI.
- Handle shutdown announcements better (we currently receive them, but don't
  really do anything with them).
- Maybe see about AppleDouble-style resource fork support?
- Kerberos support?
- Reconnect UAM support?
- Maybe DBus integration so we can call FPZzzzz() appropriately before the
  machine goes to sleep?
- Improve afp_acl.pl's support for inherited ACEs/inheritance control.
